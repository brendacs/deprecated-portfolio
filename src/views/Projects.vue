    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/me">brendacs.dev</a>. Does this website count? Though using Vue for this simple website is a bit overkill and a static site or blog generator like Jekyll might have been a more sensible choice, I wanted to ease into the framework and stop procastinating on using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/stop-bot">Discord Stop Bot</a>. A message moderation bot that automatically "stops" and deletes messages for Discord server admins and mods.

      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/newsworthy-tab">Newsworthy New Tab</a>. This one is a little embarrassing since I built it when I was first learning how to code, but I tried my hand at building a Chrome extension, a new tab page.
