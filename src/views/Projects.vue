    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/me" target="_blank">brendacs.dev</a>. Does this website count? Though using Vue for this simple website is a bit overkill and a static site or blog generator like Jekyll might have been a more sensible choice, I wanted to ease into the framework and stop procastinating on using it.
    </p>

      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/perks" target="_blank">Perks.Guide Redesign</a>. Building on top of the concept of the original Perks.Guide to add more companies, better filtering, and cleaner UI. Built with React.

    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/newsworthy-tab" target="_blank">Newsworthy New Tab</a>. This one is a little embarrassing since I built it when I was first learning how to code, but I tried my hand at building a Chrome extension, a new tab page.
    </p>

    <h2>New</h2>
    <p>
      New projects that I am actively building and are in their very early stages.

    <h2>Revisiting</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I find old files and think, "Hm, I like the concept of this enough to fix it up."</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/sleep-outreach-project" target="_blank">Sleep Outreach Project</a>. An interactive website about the benefits of sleep, built for my favorite psychology class in college.

      I was hoping you wouldn't get all the way down here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/brendacs/52in52/blob/master/log.md" target="_blank">52in52</a>. A challenge I made for myself to do 52 projects in 52 weeks a few years ago when I was first discovering frontend and the power of personal side projects in learning... I only did 4 weeks. Maybe I'll try this again sometime.
